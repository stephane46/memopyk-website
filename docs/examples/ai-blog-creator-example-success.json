Gather Your Materials\n\nStart by collecting:\n- Digital photos and videos from all family members\n- Old physical photos (scan them first)\n- Video clips from special events\n- Home movies from VHS, camcorders, or phones\n\n### 2. Organize Chronologically\n\nArrange your content in a logical order:\n- By year (childhood → present)\n- By theme (holidays, vacations, milestones)\n- By family branch (grandparents, parents, children)\n\n### 3. Select Your Soundtrack\n\nMusic sets the emotional tone. Choose songs that:\n- Reflect the time period\n- Have personal significance to your family\n- Match the pacing of your visuals\n- Avoid lyrics that compete with the story"

Tell a Story\n\nThe best memory films aren't just chronological slideshows—they tell a story with:\n\n| Story Element | Purpose |\n|--------------|----------|\n| Opening hook | Capture attention with a powerful image |\n| Rising action | Build through key milestones |\n| Emotional peaks | Highlight weddings, births, celebrations |\n| Reflection | End with present-day family or legacy message |\n\nRemember: **Less is more.** A 5-minute film with 30 carefully chosen moments is more impactful than a 30-minute compilation.",

Poor Audio Quality\n**Problem:** Music too loud, drowning out narration  \n**Solution:** Balance audio levels at -6dB for music, -3dB for voiceover\n\n### 3. Inconsistent Pacing\n**Problem:** Photos flash too quickly or linger too long  \n**Solution:** Use 3-5 seconds per photo as baseline, adjust for impact\n\n### 4. Forgetting Preservation\n**Problem:** Saving only in compressed formats  \n**Solution:** Export in high-quality format (H.264 at minimum 1080p)\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Store your finished memory film in at least 3 locations: cloud storage, external hard drive, and a physical copy (USB or DVD)."
